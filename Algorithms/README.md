# Water

### You're tense, I'm calm.
### You apply excessive force, 
### I control that force through fluid motion.
### That means relaxing the whole body,
### so it can react instantly without resistance;
### â€”no, without thought. 

### Do you see It now? 
### It means becoming like clear water.

### - Water?

### - Right!

### Water can take any form,

### It drifts without effort one moment,

### then pounds down in a torrent the very next.

### Be like water
